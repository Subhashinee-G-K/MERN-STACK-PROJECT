                <p>
                    Sustain Serve is a passionate initiative driven by the belief that no one should go to bed hungry while food goes to waste.
                    Our journey began with a simple idea ‚Äî bridge the gap between surplus and scarcity. Today, we work with a wide network of restaurants,
                    grocery stores, individuals, and volunteers who care deeply about social impact and sustainability.
                    From organizing food drives to developing tech-powered solutions for logistics and tracking, we combine compassion with innovation to tackle hunger at its roots.
                    We‚Äôve distributed over 100,000 meals and are committed to scaling our mission globally. Let‚Äôs make food equity a reality, together.
